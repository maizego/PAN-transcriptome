## Background
#### For the deep RNA-seq of the 368 maize inbred lines (DAP15 kernel), novel transcripts were de novo assemblied based on the preferred modified "assemble-then-align" strategy. After filtering and cluster steps, 2355 reference novel genes(transcripts) were obtained for the 368 panel, which were applied in further association mapping and estimation the maize pan-size.

#### Additionally, we investigated the extreme variation, expression presence and absence variation (ePAV), at the transcript level of all nuclear annotated genes together with the novel (non-reference) exressed ones. Almost one-third (13,443) nuclear genes were identified as ePAV in maize. The ePAV genes (dispensable transcriptome) are further shown to undergo different genetic mechanism and regulation roles compared with core expression genes, which tend to be much more regulated by distant eQTLs and likely to be functional as regulatory roles. We thus believe this new identified "markers" might be useful in your further specific studies.

#### Furthermore, the kernel metabolome (including 616 metabolic traits) and 17 agronomic phenotypes were used to explore the genetic architecture of pan-transcriptome and thus to give us a much more general evaluation of phenotypic contribution from dispensable expressed genes and novel ones. Importantly, the ePAV states, not the genomic variation, have been demonstrated to be valuable effective markers and easy to interpret, to make respective advantages complementary to SNP-GWAS studies in understanding the genome regulatory complexity and for applications in quantitative trait loci (QTL) cloning.
